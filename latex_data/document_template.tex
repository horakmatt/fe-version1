{\bf What This Means}
\bigskip

\hl{TO ROLA: For now, would this section be static, or give bullets related to the negative reasons?  If we were eventually to do a "counterfactual" method for explanation like we talked about, this section might include some insights from that.\\ \bigskip}


\noindent This decision does not prevent future applications. Businesses often strengthen their profile by:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Building longer trading history and financial resilience.
	\item  Reducing existing debt and improving affordability.
	\item  Offering stronger collateral of personal guarantees.
	\item  Demonstrating consistent, stable cashflows.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Commitment to Fairness}
\bigskip

\noindent We understand a decline can be disappointing. Our process is designed to be {\bf fair, transparent, and responsible}. By sharing both strengths and areas for improvement, we aim to provide clarity and constructive guidance so that businesses have a clear path to return stronger in the future.\smallskip
